# Dèmos: The People

**Dèmos: The People** is a social experiment born from the shadows of the *Dead Internet Theory*. Its existence is whispered — access spreads only through word of mouth. The link is never openly shared. Participants join anonymously, leaving behind names, faces, and traces. To enter with a distinctive username is to break an unspoken rule.

## Governance

There are no administrators. No overseers. The People govern themselves.

Each day at midnight, through a relentless democracy of votes, those deemed unwanted are cast out. Their voices remain, but their presence is erased. No talk is ever deletable — every word lingers, every trace of thought becomes permanent.

## Philosophy

Nothing rules the People. No algorithm. No law.

The talk is the only way to exist.
